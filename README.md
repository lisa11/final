On how to add a product to the website:

The products new page where the user enters information about a product they are using. This is a dropdown list of brand name the users enter. If the brand name of the product is not there, the user can go to the brands page and add a brand name manually.

The dropdown list for skin type is already set and users cannot change or add any. The same applies for skincare category and makeup category.

The checkboxes for skincare and makeup indicates whether the product is a skincare product or a makeup product (or it can be both if thatâ€™s what the user wants). If the product is a skincare one (skincare box checked), the user would need to check this before choosing from the dropdown list. Otherwise, the form will not go through. Same thing for the makeup check box.

Notice that there is no edit or delete button for both brands and products. This is intentional. The reason why there is no edit or delete button is because the users share this same information. If there is a popular product that many users use, they can just choose from the list instead of adding it manually. For now, if they want to update the information, they would need to contact the database person. They cannot delete the information since other users also use them. It will cause confusion if the information about the product suddenly changes or if the product disappeared overnight.
